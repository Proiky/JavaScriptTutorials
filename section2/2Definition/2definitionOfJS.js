/* What is JS?

JS instructs computer to do something! We dont have think about managing computer memory which is
 what makes him a high level programming language.
 It is Object oriented! 
 On web we use JSS, HTML and JS to make applications. HTML is responsible for content on web-page
 CSS is responsible for presentation where JS is a programming language of the internet.
 We use it for building web app's.
 JS allows us to add dynamic effects and make whole applications in the browser!
 ANGULAR, REACT - tools that make writing large-scale apps faster and easier! but they are still
 100% based on JS.

 FRONT-END:
 when we write JS apps in a browser

 BACK-END:
 (nodejs) -> when we use JS outside of the browser enviroment, communicationing on web servers

 ES6 or ES2015 -> biggest update to the language EVER.
 from 2015 its considered to be MODERN JAVA SCRIPT! -> which we are going to learn and use.
